Enhanced Console Countdown Timer
This is a versatile, console-based countdown timer written in Python. It allows you to set a duration in minutes (including decimal values), provides a real-time countdown, and signals the end with an audible (or visual) "buzz" notification.

Features
Flexible Duration Input: Set the timer for any number of minutes, including decimal values (e.g., 0.5 for 30 seconds, 1.75 for 1 minute and 45 seconds).

Minute:Second Display: Displays the remaining time in a clear MM:SS format, with each second printed on a new line for readability.

Real-time Countdown: Counts down second by second.

End Notification: Plays a "buzz" sound (via the ASCII bell character) when the timer reaches zero.

Robust Input Handling: Gracefully handles non-numeric or non-positive input values.

How it Works
The script leverages Python's standard library:

time: For pausing execution (time.sleep(1)) to create the real-time countdown.

math: Specifically math.ceil() to correctly round up the total seconds (derived from decimal minute input) ensuring even small fractions of a second result in at least a 1-second countdown.

The divmod() function is used to convert total seconds into minutes and remaining seconds for display.

The print('\a') command sends the ASCII bell character to your terminal, which typically produces a beep or visual flash.

Important Notes
Sound Compatibility: The "buzz" notification relies on the ASCII bell character (\a).

Effectiveness Varies: Whether this produces an audible sound or just a visual flash depends entirely on your operating system, your terminal emulator's settings, and its capabilities. Some terminals might play a beep, others might flash the window, and some might do nothing at all.

No Vibration: This script cannot make your physical device vibrate.

Platform-Specific Alternatives (Not Included): For more reliable beeps on specific operating systems (e.g., winsound on Windows, afplay command on macOS via os.system), platform-specific code would be required. This version sticks to the most portable pure-Python method.

Fractional Input Handling: When you enter a decimal value for minutes (e.g., 0.01 minutes, which is 0.6 seconds), math.ceil() rounds this up to 1 second. This means any positive input, no matter how small, will result in at least a one-second countdown displayed (00:01).

Console-Based: This is a command-line interface (CLI) application. It does not have a graphical user interface (GUI).

Requirements
Python 3.x

How to Run the Application
Save the Code:

Copy the entire Python code for the timer into a file named countdown_timer.py (or any other name ending with .py).

Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:

Navigate to the directory where you saved countdown_timer.py using the cd command.

Example (Windows): cd C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\my_scripts

Example (macOS/Linux): cd ~/Documents/my_scripts

Run the Script:

Execute the Python script using the command:

python countdown_timer.py

How to Use
After running the script, you will be prompted to enter the duration:

Enter the duration of the timer in minutes (e.g., 0.5 for 30 seconds):

Type a positive number (integer or decimal, e.g., 5, 0.5, 1.75) and press Enter.

The timer will start counting down in the console, with each second displayed on a new line:

00:05
00:04
00:03
00:02
00:01

Once the time reaches zero, it will print "Time's up!" and attempt to play a beep sound.

Possible Enhancements
GUI: Develop a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.

Custom Sound File: Play a specific audio file instead of the system beep.

Pause/Resume Functionality: Add controls to pause and resume the countdown.

Multiple Timers: Implement support for running and managing multiple timers simultaneously.

Configurable Beep: Allow users to choose if they want a beep, and possibly its duration/frequency (if platform-specific sound modules are integrated).
